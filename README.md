An app that can add Apple device shell to pictures.

> Due to apple's restriction, the app's name is now changed to PicsCase.

## Introduction
The main reason I developed this app is because I am a graduate student. I need to report on scientific research every week, and the scientific research report needs to be displayed in Keynote. It would be too ugly to add pictures directly to the slideshow, so I often add a Mac or iPad or iPhone case to some pictures to beautify my slides.

Before I developed this app, I always used Photoshop or Sketch to achieve this function, but the high price made me a little bit discouraged, and the problem of slow Photoshop startup has always bothered me, so I came up with an idea: dev an app to achieve this function. Hence the birth of PicsCase.
